Using Minikube to Create a Cluster   

A Kubernetes cluster consists of two types of resources:   
1. The Control Plane coordinates the cluster  
2. Nodes are the workers that run applications  


A node is a VM or a physical computer that serves as a worker machine in a Kubernetes cluster.    
Each node has a Kubelet, which is an agent for managing the node and communicating with the Kubernetes control plane.   

The node should also have tools for handling container operations, such as containerd or Docker.  

 
When you deploy applications on Kubernetes, you tell the control plane to start the application containers.   
The control plane schedules the containers to run on the cluster's nodes.   



The nodes communicate with the control plane using the Kubernetes API, which the control plane exposes.   
End users can also use the Kubernetes API directly to interact with the cluster.  
A Kubernetes cluster can be deployed on either physical or virtual machines.   




To get started with Kubernetes development, you can use Minikube.   



Cluster up and running  
Start the cluster, by running the `minikube start` command.   
Minikube started a virtual machine for you, and a Kubernetes cluster is now running in that VM.
