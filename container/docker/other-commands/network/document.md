There are two ways to put a container on a network:  
1. Assign it at start  
2. Connect an existing container  




the `nicolaka/netshoot container`, which ships with a lot of tools that are useful for troubleshooting or debugging networking issues.  
`docker run -it --network todo-app nicolaka/netshoot`
